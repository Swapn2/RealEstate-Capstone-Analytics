# üèôÔ∏è Real Estate Capstone Project ‚Äì Gurgaon Housing Analytics Platform

This project is a full-stack, data science‚Äìdriven web application for analyzing and predicting real estate trends in **Gurgaon**, built using **Streamlit** with a **multi-page architecture**.

---

## üîß Website Modules

### 1. Analytics Module
- **Spatial Analysis**:
  - Heatmap overlay on Gurgaon map with dynamic color scale based on price.
- **Price Distribution**:
  - Visual comparison of property prices across Gurgaon sectors.
- **Price vs Area Analysis**:
  - Interactive scatter plot with dropdown filters (entire Gurgaon, individual sectors).
- **Room Distribution**:
  - Pie chart showing bedroom count distribution by sector.
- **Top Features**:
  - Word cloud showing most frequent property features.

### 2. Insight Module
- Simulates the **effect of adding/removing features** (playground, parking, pooja room, etc.) on property price using trained regression models.

### 3. Price Prediction Module
- Takes user-defined filters and predicts **property price** using optimized ML models.
- Output includes price and performance confidence.

### 4. Recommender System
- Built 3 types of content-based recommenders using `TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity`:
  - **Price-based** recommendation.
  - **Location-based** recommendation.
  - **Feature-based** recommendation.

## üìå Technical Stack & Architecture

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Multi-page app)
- **Backend/Modeling**: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud
- **Clustering**: KMeans (for furnishing categorization)
- **EDA Tools**: Pandas, Pandas Profiling

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Execution Pipeline

### Day 1 ‚Äì Planning & Data Prep
- Cleaned flat and house datasets.
- Merged, standardized locality names, extracted Gurgaon sectors.
- Split area into Carpet, Built-up, and Super built-up.
- Parsed and separated features: rooms, furnishing, amenities.

### Day 2 ‚Äì Feature Engineering & EDA
- Created structured columns for:
  - Bedrooms, bathrooms, servant/store/pooja rooms.
  - Furnishing details (AC, geyser, fan, etc.).
- Used **KMeans** to cluster and label furnishing levels.
- Performed detailed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate EDA.
- Automated EDA with Pandas Profiling.
- Treated outliers and imputed missing values.

## üß† Model Development

### Models Trained:
- **Linear Regression**
- **SVR**
- **Ridge & Lasso**
- **Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees**
- **Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost**
- **MLP Regressor**
- **XGBoost**

### Feature Encoding Methods:
- One-Hot Encoding (OHE)
- Ordinal Encoding
- Target Encoding
- PCA for dimensionality reduction

### Evaluation:
- Compared model results across 3 setups: OHE, PCA, Target Encoding
- Selected **RandomForestRegressor** as best-performing model.

### Final Scores:
- **R¬≤ Score**: 0.8989
- **MAE**: 0.5448

## ü§ù Final Deployment & Streamlit Integration

- All trained models and pipelines exported.
- Integrated into Streamlit app with multi-tab interface.
- Deployed modules:
  - Visual Analytics
  - Feature-based Insights
  - Price Predictor
  - Smart Recommender

## üîÅ Scope for Expansion

1. Extend to **PAN-India** city data.
2. Include **independent floors**, **residential plots**, and **commercial properties**.
3. Enhance models with stacking, ensembling, or DL methods.
4. Periodic **automated scraping** and database integration.
5. Integrate **open datasets** (e.g., `data.gov.in`) for macro insights.
