## 🔍 Project Modules

### 📊 1. Analytics Dashboard

Interactive visual tools powered by **Streamlit**:

- **📌 Spatial Heat Map**  
  City or sector-level price heatmaps based on scraped data.

- **📈 Price Distribution**  
  Compare property prices across locations within a city.

- **📐 Price vs. Area Analysis**  
  Visualize cost per square foot, filterable by city, sector, and locality.

- **🏘️ Room Count Distribution**  
  Pie charts showing the share of 1BHK, 2BHK, etc., properties.

- **☁️ Feature Word Cloud**  
  Commonly advertised property features visualized in an eye-catching way.
